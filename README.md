# Lyx thesis template

This is a Lyx thesis template for Australian National University (ANU), although it is easily adapted to over universities. It is based on the the LaTeX template created by Steve Blackburn and distributed on the ANU CECS website.

Put your name and thesis title in the file main-preamble.tex, and you should be set.

Details of how this template was created, and how to modify it are in this [blog post](http://www.aarondefazio.com/tangentially/?p=19). Source code hosted on github [here](https://github.com/adefazio/lyx-thesis-template).

The default font is Palatino, this can be changed in general-preamble.tex, just change \usepackage[palatino]{anuthesis} to use either computer modern (cm), lucida or times.
